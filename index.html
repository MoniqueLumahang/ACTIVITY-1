            <p class="p">Furniture includes objects such as tables, chairs, beds, desks, dressers, and cupboards. 
            These objects are usually kept in a house or other building to make it suitable or comfortable for living or working in. 
            The word furniture comes from the French fourniture, which means equipment. In most other European languages, however, the corresponding word 
            (German MÃ¶bel, French meuble, Spanish mueble, Italian mobile) is derived from the Latin adjective mobilis, meaning movable.</p>

            <p class="p">The furniture in your home and workspace is one component that significantly impacts your living quality. 
            Inadequate furniture can cause body pains, stress, decreased productivity, and a lower quality of life. 
            A good quality piece of furniture should be structurally sound, solid and well-built to ensure its prolonged use over the years. 
            You should feel safe when sitting in, or leaning on the piece, and you shouldn't be able to recognize any sway, give or flex in it. The furniture in your home and workspace is one component that significantly impacts your living quality.

            <p class="pp">A good rule to making a cosy, comfy space is pillows and lots of them. If it's in a corner, cushions and soft throws or blankets can help to complete the feel. 
            Also, using big pillows on the floor can add an extra level of luxurious comfort and takes away the rigidity. Probably the single most important piece of furniture 
            in any living room is the sofa. Couches tend to be the largest and most expensive pieces you will buy, and we all know how important it is to have a comfy place to 
            rest our bodies after a long day. A good rule to making a cosy, comfy space is pillows and lots of them. If it's in a corner, cushions and soft throws or blankets can help to complete the feel.
